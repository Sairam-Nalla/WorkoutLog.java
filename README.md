# WorkoutLog.java
Program assists the user in keeping track of their workouts and the date they are logged into a text file labelled "WorkoutLog.txt". I created this program in order ot assist myself in seeing how I am progressing in the gym overtime. Instead of writing down my progress in a journal that I could potentially lose I decided to keep track of everything in a text file since I am mostly infront of my computer 24/7. This program uses fundamental java concepts suchs as OOP, inheritance, and exception handling in a well explained program that anyone can follow along and understand from reading the comments.
